Notes: 
    - you need to have python working on your computer. you can find it here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
    - the programm should work fine for linux, windows & mac. However, if you have any problem on your windows or mac, please mail me as soon as possible so I can fix it in time.

You can find the rules in the file tutorial.txt; alternatively I suggest you run tutorial.py to play a test-game against a random opponent.

The game is played by running main.py. You play cards by typing an integer then "enter". If you type anything else the program will crash; please do not use this intentionally. 
At the end of each game, the logs are automatically stored in logs.txt. When you are done participating in the experiment, please send this file to me at thomas.boudier@gssi.it 

IMPORTANT: executions are done from the /src folder
